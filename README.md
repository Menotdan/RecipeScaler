# Recipe Scaler

This is a web-based tool to scale recipes in a simple manner from just a text file- Or you can link a website!

To build, you will need `node` and `npm`. First, run `npm install`. Next, run `npm run build` and the website will be compiled to `built-site/`. If you would like to host a development server, you can install `http-server` with `npm install http-server -g` and then you can call `npm start`.
